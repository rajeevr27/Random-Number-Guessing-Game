# Random-Number-Guessing-Game

This is my implementation of a Random Number Guessing Game written in JavaScript that generates a number between 1 and 100.  The user is prompted to enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field. The program then proceeds to determine if the number entered is the random number, higher than the random number, lower than the random number, not a valid number, or has exceeded the number of guesses allowed.
